# WorldHappinessLevel

The World Happiness Report 2024 offers a detailed analysis of global well-being, using parameters
such as Life Ladder (life satisfaction), GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy,
freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. By analyzing data from 2006 to 2023, the
report uncovers key trends that can guide families considering immigration.

This project leverages these insights to develop an interactive visualization tool that aids families
in making informed decisions about potential destinations. Using a Martini-Glass storytelling
approach, we begin with a guided narrative to introduce global happiness trends, then transition
into an interactive phase. Users can explore a world map of happiness scores, analyze historical
trends, forecast future scores, and compare countries based on factors like social support or
economic stability.

The goal is to transform the vast data from the report into actionable insights, helping families
prioritize countries that align with their unique needs for a better quality of life.
